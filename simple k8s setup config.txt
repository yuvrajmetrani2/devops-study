complete application setup with kubernetes components


typical simple setup of a database and its web application
mongodb and mongo-express


overview of k8s components
- 2 deployment/pod
- 2 service
- 1 configmap
- 1 secret

first we will create a mongodb pod. To talk to that pod, we will need an internal service.
no external requests are allowed to the pod. 

then we create a mongo-express deploymnet. 
- we need a database url of mongodb, to connect to mongodb
- credentials - to connect to database

we pass the info to the mongoexpress deployment is through the mongodb deployment configuration file through environemntal varialbles

We will create a configmap that contaiins teh database url and we are going to create a secret that contains the credentails. and we are going to reference both in the deployment configuration file. 
once we have that setup, we need the mongo express to be accessible though the browser. so we need an external service. 

So the url will be http ip address of node
- port of the external service.

To create an ecrypted string
----------------------------

echo -n "username" | base64  # outputs the encrypted string

echo -n "<encryptedString>" | base64 -d # decrypted string
